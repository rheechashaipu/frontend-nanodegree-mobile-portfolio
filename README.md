# frontend-nanodegree-mobile-portfolio

For this project I was given a site that did not render at 60fps and scored less than 90 on Google's Pagespeed Insights.

I made adjustments to CSS, Javascript, and images until the site was able to refresh at 60fps as well as score well above a 90
Google's Pagespeed Insights.

To check out the site's performance, simply download the repo and examine the site through Chrome's dev tools.

Note: There is no live link yet to test the Pagepeed Insights score, but if you want to check out what kind of scores this site
gets you can download the repo and host it on a server then link the site to the address bar on this site -
